# rancher-catalog
Custom rancher catalog repository (mostly for mesos clusters)

# Goal

The goal is to add more functions what I did miss in my work with rancher. Rancher is a great project but it misses a building block in some aeras. The goal is to fill this gaps at leats in aerach my work required. As a fan of Open Source I do not want to close my work in this aera. I hope you will benefit from this and share your modifications with rest of the OS community.

# Installation

Go to rancher documentation about information in how to use custom catalogs. When you add this catalog to rancher you will be able to use graphical one-click method for deployments.
